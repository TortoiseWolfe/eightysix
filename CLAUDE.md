# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Core Development Principles

1. **Proper Solutions Over Quick Fixes** - Implement correctly the first time
2. **Root Cause Analysis** - Fix underlying issues, not symptoms
3. **Stability Over Speed** - This is a production template
4. **Clean Architecture** - Follow established patterns consistently
5. **No Technical Debt** - Never commit TODOs or workarounds

## Docker-First Development (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: This project REQUIRES Docker. Local pnpm/npm commands are NOT supported.

### NEVER Install Packages Locally

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** - Never run these commands on the host machine:

```bash
# ❌ CRITICAL NO - NEVER do any of these locally
npm install
npm install --no-save <package>
pnpm install
pnpm add <package>
yarn install
npx <anything>

# ✅ CORRECT - Always use Docker
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm install
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm add <package>
```

**Why this is critical:**

- Creates local `node_modules` with wrong permissions (Docker-owned)
- Causes conflicts between host and container dependencies
- Breaks the Docker-first architecture
- Creates cleanup nightmares (Docker-owned files can't be deleted by host user)

**If you accidentally installed locally:**

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose run --rm scripthammer rm -rf node_modules
docker compose up
```

### NEVER Use sudo - Use Docker Instead

When encountering permission errors, **NEVER use `sudo`**. Use Docker:

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Don't do this
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .next
sudo rm -rf node_modules

# ✅ CORRECT - Use Docker
docker compose exec scripthammer rm -rf .next
docker compose exec scripthammer rm -rf node_modules
docker compose down && docker compose up
```

**Why**: The container runs as your user (UID/GID from .env). Docker commands execute with correct permissions automatically.

**Permission errors? Always try:**

1. `docker compose down && docker compose up` (restarts container, cleans .next)
2. `docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run docker:clean`

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Start development
docker compose up

# Development server
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run dev

# Run tests
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run test:suite    # Full suite

# Storybook
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run storybook

# E2E tests
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm exec playwright test

# Type checking & linting
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run type-check
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run lint

# Clean start if issues
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run docker:clean
```

### Git Commits from Docker

Git hooks may fail when running locally if the repo was set up inside Docker. Always commit from inside the container:

```bash
# Configure git identity (add to .env)
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=Your Name
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=your@email.com

# Commit from container (hooks run correctly)
docker compose exec scripthammer git add -A
docker compose exec scripthammer git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push from host (uses your SSH keys)
git push
```

### Supabase Keep-Alive

Supabase Cloud free tier auto-pauses after 7 days. If paused:

```bash
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run prime
```

## Component Structure (MANDATORY)

Components must follow the 5-file pattern or CI/CD will fail:

```
ComponentName/
├── index.tsx                             # Barrel export
├── ComponentName.tsx                     # Main component
├── ComponentName.test.tsx                # Unit tests (REQUIRED)
├── ComponentName.stories.tsx             # Storybook (REQUIRED)
└── ComponentName.accessibility.test.tsx  # A11y tests (REQUIRED)
```

**Always use the generator:**

```bash
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run generate:component
```

See `docs/CREATING_COMPONENTS.md` for details.

## Architecture Overview

- **Next.js 15** with App Router, static export
- **React 19** with TypeScript strict mode
- **Tailwind CSS 4** + DaisyUI (32 themes)
- **Supabase** - Auth, Database, Storage, Realtime
- **PWA** with Service Worker (offline support)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E), Pa11y (a11y)

## Static Hosting Constraint

This app is deployed to GitHub Pages (static hosting). This means:

- NO server-side API routes (`src/app/api/` won't work in production)
- NO access to non-NEXT*PUBLIC* environment variables in browser
- All server-side logic must be in Supabase (database, Edge Functions, or triggers)

When implementing features that need secrets:

- Use Supabase Vault for secure storage
- Use Edge Functions for server-side logic
- Or design client-side solutions that don't require secrets

**Example**: The welcome message system uses ECDH shared secret symmetry to encrypt
messages "from" admin without needing admin's password at runtime. The admin's
public key is pre-stored in the database, and `ECDH(user_private, admin_public)`
produces the same shared secret as `ECDH(admin_private, user_public)`.

```

## PRP/SpecKit Workflow

For features taking >1 day:

1. Write PRP: `docs/prp-docs/<feature>-prp.md`
2. Create branch: `./scripts/prp-to-feature.sh <feature> <number>`
3. Run SpecKit (full 7-step workflow):
   ```
   /specify → /clarify → /plan → /checklist → /tasks → /analyze → /implement
   ```

### SpecKit Commands

| Command      | Purpose                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/specify`   | Create feature specification from PRP                |
| `/clarify`   | Ask clarifying questions, encode answers into spec   |
| `/plan`      | Generate implementation plan from spec               |
| `/checklist` | Generate custom checklist for the feature            |
| `/tasks`     | Generate dependency-ordered tasks.md                 |
| `/analyze`   | Cross-artifact consistency check (spec, plan, tasks) |
| `/implement` | Execute the implementation plan                      |

See `docs/prp-docs/SPECKIT-PRP-GUIDE.md` for details.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Permission Errors

**Always use Docker, never sudo:**

```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up
```

### Slow Supabase (10-30 seconds)

Instance paused after inactivity:

```bash
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run prime
```

### Tailwind CSS Not Loading

1. Don't import Leaflet CSS in `globals.css`
2. Import Leaflet CSS only in map components
3. Restart container after CSS changes

### Port 3000 In Use

```bash
docker compose down
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
```

## Test Users

**Primary** (required):

- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `TestPassword123!`

**Secondary** (optional - for email verification tests):

- Configure in `.env`: `TEST_USER_SECONDARY_EMAIL`, `TEST_USER_SECONDARY_PASSWORD`

## GitHub Actions Secrets

For CI/CD deployment, add these secrets in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Repository secrets**:

### Required for Deployment

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### Optional but Recommended

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAGESPEED_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_NAME=Your Name
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_EMAIL=your@email.com
```

See `README.md` for the complete list of available secrets.

## Supabase Database Migrations (CRITICAL)

**NEVER create separate migration files.** This project uses a **monolithic migration file**:

```
supabase/migrations/20251006_complete_monolithic_setup.sql
```

### Adding Schema Changes

1. **Edit the monolithic file directly** - Add new tables, columns, indexes to the appropriate section
2. **Use `IF NOT EXISTS`** - All CREATE statements must be idempotent
3. **Add to existing transaction** - New schema goes inside the `BEGIN;`...`COMMIT;` block
4. **Execute via Supabase Management API** - Use `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` from `.env`

### Executing Migrations (Claude Code)

**NEVER tell the user to run migrations manually.** Use the Supabase Management API:

```bash
# Check for access token in .env
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=<project-ref>

# Execute SQL via Management API
curl -X POST "https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/${PROJECT_REF}/database/query" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "SELECT 1"}'
```

**DO NOT:**

- Tell user to copy SQL to dashboard manually
- Install database clients locally (pg, psql, etc.)
- Try direct database connections from Docker (DNS issues)

### Example: Adding a Column

```sql
-- Add to the appropriate table section in the monolithic file
ALTER TABLE user_encryption_keys
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS encryption_salt TEXT;
```

### Why Monolithic?

- Single source of truth for entire schema
- Can recreate database from scratch with one file
- No migration ordering issues
- Supabase Cloud doesn't support CLI migrations on free tier

**DO NOT:**

- Create files like `032_add_encryption_salt.sql`
- Suggest running SQL snippets piecemeal
- Use Supabase CLI migrations

## CI & E2E Stability (Round 10 Lessons, 2026-05-13)

The E2E suite ran against a single shared Supabase project for months and accumulated **9 rounds of "flake mitigation"** that all attacked symptoms. Round 10 (PR #89, commit `996211e`) finally identified the underlying root cause and fixed it structurally. These rules exist so future contributors don't re-derive the same painful path.

### NEVER merge a PR while another PR's CI is running against the same backend

**Why**: this is what caused issue #85 to compound. Two concurrent E2E runs against the same Supabase project race each other's `cleanupOldMessages` `beforeAll` hooks across 11+ messaging specs. Each run wipes data the other run is polling for. One run hits the 60-min GitHub Actions job cap and gets cancelled.

**Now protected by**: `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` has a repo-wide `concurrency:` mutex (`group: e2e-supabase-${{ github.repository }}`, `cancel-in-progress: false`). Concurrent E2E runs queue; they never race. But the rule still applies to other shared backends in the future.

**Verification it's active**: trigger two pushes within 1 minute; the second workflow shows "Queued, waiting for another workflow run" in the Actions UI.

### NEVER bypass commit hooks (no `--no-verify`)

**Why**: husky + lint-staged + gitleaks all run pre-commit and catch real bugs. Yesterday's session almost shipped secrets in a doc PR; gitleaks caught it. The user explicitly forbids `--no-verify` unless they ask for it.

**If a hook fails**: investigate. Hook output names the file + line. Fix the underlying issue, re-stage, commit. Never `git commit --no-verify` as an escape hatch.

### Programmatic `el.scrollTop = N` does NOT fire scroll events reliably in WebKit

**Why this matters**: Chromium and Firefox auto-fire the `scroll` event when JavaScript assigns to `scrollTop`. WebKit (Playwright's Linux build) does not always do this. Yesterday's `messaging-scroll.spec.ts:261` test ("T007-T008: Jump button appears when scrolled") failed all 3 retries on webkit-msg because the React `handleScroll` listener at `src/components/molecular/MessageThread/MessageThread.tsx:194` never ran.

**The fix pattern** (now applied at 4 sites in `tests/e2e/messaging/`):

```typescript
await el.evaluate((el) => {
  el.scrollTop = N;
  el.dispatchEvent(new Event('scroll', { bubbles: true })); // <-- explicit dispatch for WebKit
});
```

Apply this any time test code sets `scrollTop` and expects a scroll-event-driven UI side effect.

### Branch hygiene — NON-NEGOTIABLE

- **`delete_branch_on_merge=true`** is set on the repo. Every merged PR auto-deletes its head branch. Don't undo this.
- **After merging**, always `git fetch --prune origin` to drop the dead remote-tracking ref locally.
- **Never leave unmerged branches or open PRs sitting around** between work items. Merge or close one before starting the next.
- **Avoid stacked PRs** unless dependency is unavoidable. When a parent PR merges with `delete_branch_on_merge=true`, GitHub auto-closes any child PR using that parent as its base (known footgun — happened to PR #87 yesterday). Re-target the child to `main` and reopen.

### CI logs API ≠ UI

- **Authoritative state**: `gh run view <id> --json status,conclusion,jobs` or REST API
- **UI is misleading**: the workflow-run-list page shows the workflow's _overall_ status with the most-recent activity timestamp. That timestamp is when the _last queued sub-job started_, not when the run as a whole started. Reading "In progress 10:35 PM" as "nothing started yet" is wrong but easy to do.
- **For per-job status**: click into the run itself (job-graph view) or use the API. Don't trust the list page.

## Important Notes

- Never create components manually - use the generator
- All PRs must pass component structure validation
- **E2E tests DO run in CI** (chromium + firefox + webkit across 28 shards) — was previously local-only but is now part of the GitHub Actions pipeline; see "CI & E2E Stability" above
- Docker-first development is mandatory
- Use `min-h-11 min-w-11` for 44px touch targets (mobile-first)

## Planning Factory (Multi-Terminal Workflow)

This repo also contains the planning factory tooling from the ScriptHammer planning template. The sections below govern the multi-terminal spec-driven workflow.

### Multi-Terminal Assembly Line

Claude Code terminals in a tmux session arranged in assembly line order:

```
STRATEGY:    CTO → ProductOwner → BusinessAnalyst
DESIGN:      Architect → UXDesigner → UIDesigner
CODE:        Developer → Toolsmith → Security
TEST:        TestEngineer → QALead → Auditor
DOCS:        Author → TechWriter
RELEASE:     DevOps → DockerCaptain → ReleaseManager → Coordinator
```

Wireframe work has been consolidated onto the SpecKit `/speckit.wireframe.*`
skills — the dedicated 6-role wireframe tmux pipeline was retired and
absorbed into the Developer / UIDesigner terminals' normal workflow.

See `.claude/roles/` for role-specific context:

| File                | Roles                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `operator.md`       | Operator (runs outside tmux)                                          |
| `council.md`        | CTO, ProductOwner, Architect, UXDesigner, Toolsmith, Security, DevOps |
| `design.md`         | UIDesigner                                                            |
| `implementation.md` | Developer, TestEngineer, QALead, Auditor                              |
| `support.md`        | Author, TechWriter, BusinessAnalyst, Coordinator                      |
| `release.md`        | DevOps, DockerCaptain, ReleaseManager                                 |
| `stw-liaison.md`    | StW-Liaison (client operator for SpokeToWork)                         |

### Terminal Git Rules

When operating as a terminal in the multi-terminal workflow:

- **COMMIT ONLY, NEVER PUSH** — Only the Operator has SSH access to push
- Stay in your lane: commit your work and move on

### Feature Specs & Wireframes

- `features/<category>/<NNN-name>/` — feature specifications (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md) + per-feature `wireframes/` subdir with SVGs and shared chrome
- `features/IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md` — dependency graph + tier ordering
- `.claude/inventories/` — codebase inventory snapshots (run `/refresh-inventories` after spec changes)
- `/wireframes` Next.js route iframes the manifest-driven viewer (auto-discovers all SVGs; build-synced by `scripts/sync-wireframes.sh`)

### SVG Wireframe Rules

- Canvas: `viewBox="0 0 1920 1080" width="1920" height="1080"`
- Desktop: x=40, y=60, 1280×720 | Mobile: x=1360, y=60, 360×720
- Panel color: `#e8d4b8` (never white)
- Touch targets: 44px minimum
- Machine validation: `.specify/extensions/wireframe/scripts/validate.py`

### Fork Guide

After forking ScriptHammer:

1. Run `/refresh-inventories` — Regenerates context files for your specs
2. Update `.claude/inventories/` — Reflects your project's features
3. Modify `features/IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md` — Your dependency sequence
