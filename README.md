## 🚀 Quick Start

> 💡 **New to ScriptHammer?** Start at [`docs/FORK-CHECKLIST.md`](./docs/FORK-CHECKLIST.md) for the complete service-setup matrix — which env vars to set, which services are required vs. optional, where to sign up for each, and the suggested setup order. The Quick Start below is just the bare minimum to boot the dev server.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git configured

### Docker Development (MANDATORY)

This project **REQUIRES Docker** for development to ensure consistency across all environments.

```bash
# 1. Use this template on GitHub (your project name is auto-detected!)
# 2. Clone YOUR new repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.git
cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME

# 3. Create and configure .env file (REQUIRED)
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env to add your services (all optional except UID/GID):
# - Google Analytics ID
# - EmailJS/Web3Forms credentials
# - Calendar integration URLs
# - Author information
# See .env.example for all available options

# 4. Start Docker development environment
docker compose up     # Start everything (first build takes 5-10 minutes)

# Development is now running at http://localhost:3000
```

### Common Docker Commands

```bash
# Run commands inside container
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run dev         # Dev server
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm test            # Run tests
docker compose exec scripthammer pnpm run storybook   # Storybook

# Clean restart if needed
docker compose down
docker compose up --build
```

**NOTE**: Local pnpm/npm commands are NOT supported. All development MUST use Docker.

## 💳 Payment Integration Setup

**Heads-up for forkers**: Payment integration (Stripe one-time + PayPal subscriptions + GDPR consent flow) is **built into this template** but is **NOT activated out of the box**. No API keys are committed — you must create your own accounts and configure them before `/payment-demo` will work against live sandbox APIs.

**Security — where keys go**:

- **`.env.example`** is committed to git. NEVER put real values here. Only placeholders.
- **`.env`** is gitignored. Safe for `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` public keys (e.g. Stripe publishable key, PayPal client ID — these ship in the client bundle by design).
- **Supabase Vault** is where server secrets live (Stripe secret + webhook secret, PayPal secret + webhook ID). This is a static export to GitHub Pages — there's no Next.js server runtime, so anything without a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix in `.env` is unused. Server secrets are only readable by Supabase Edge Functions via `Deno.env.get(...)`.

**Quick setup** (~30-60 minutes of external account work):

1. **Stripe** — create an account at [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com), grab **test-mode** publishable key (`pk_test_...`) and secret key (`sk_test_...`) from Developers → API keys. Set up a webhook endpoint pointing to your Supabase `stripe-webhook` Edge Function URL and copy the signing secret (`whsec_...`).
2. **PayPal** — create a sandbox app at [developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com) → Apps & Credentials → Sandbox → Create App. Grab client ID and secret. Create a sandbox webhook and copy its webhook ID.
3. **Populate the two places**:
   - Public keys (`NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`) → `.env`
   - Server secrets (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`) → Supabase Vault via `supabase secrets set` or the Supabase dashboard → Project Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets
4. **Test** — Stripe test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`, PayPal sandbox buyer accounts. No real money moves in test/sandbox mode.

Once configured, `/payment-demo` should work end-to-end against sandbox APIs. The payment E2E test stubs (~47 skipped tests under `tests/e2e/payment/`) can then be un-skipped as each dependent feature is implemented.

**Full deployment guide**: [docs/PAYMENT-DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/PAYMENT-DEPLOYMENT.md) covers the complete 256-line walkthrough including Supabase project setup, database migrations, Edge Function deployment, webhook event subscriptions, and production cutover.

**Current payment implementation status**: [docs/prp-docs/PRP-STATUS.md#v040--payments-active-tracking](./docs/prp-docs/PRP-STATUS.md) — shows which features are built, which need routes, and which need UI work.

## 🔐 Authentication Setup

ScriptHammer ships with full email/password + OAuth (GitHub, Google) authentication via Supabase. Out of the box, the app won't authenticate users until you create a Supabase project and configure your auth providers.

**For a brand-new forker**: start at [`docs/FORK-CHECKLIST.md`](./docs/FORK-CHECKLIST.md) — it's the master walkthrough covering every service this template integrates with.

**For auth specifically**:

1. **Create a Supabase project** at [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) (free tier is fine)
2. **Run database migrations** — see [`docs/AUTH-SETUP.md` Part 1](./docs/AUTH-SETUP.md#part-1-database-setup)
3. **Configure auth providers** (pick what you need):
   - [Email/password](./docs/AUTH-SETUP.md#part-2-enable-emailpassword-authentication) — required for the messaging features
   - [GitHub OAuth](./docs/AUTH-SETUP.md#part-3-enable-github-oauth-optional) — create a [GitHub OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - [Google OAuth](./docs/AUTH-SETUP.md#part-4-enable-google-oauth-optional) — create a [Google Cloud OAuth client](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
4. **Add Supabase keys to `.env`** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from [your project's API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
5. **Verify** — run the [Management API check](./docs/AUTH-SETUP.md#verification-via-management-api) to confirm your OAuth client IDs are real values, not placeholders. (Issue #85 was caused by placeholder strings sitting in this field for weeks before anyone noticed.)

The full step-by-step is in [`docs/AUTH-SETUP.md`](./docs/AUTH-SETUP.md) (Parts 1-7, ~380 lines).

## 🔐 GitHub Actions Secrets

Add these secrets to your repository at **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Repository secrets**.

### ⚠️ Required for CI/CD (Add These First)

These secrets are **required** for the build and deployment workflows to succeed:

| Secret                          | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | Your Supabase project URL (e.g., `https://abc123.supabase.co`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Your Supabase anonymous/public key                             |

### 🧪 Recommended for E2E Testing

These secrets enable full E2E test coverage. Without them, E2E tests will be skipped or fail:

| Secret                         | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`    | Service role key for admin operations in tests                         |
| `TEST_USER_PRIMARY_EMAIL`      | Primary test user email (use Gmail plus alias: `you+test-a@gmail.com`) |
| `TEST_USER_PRIMARY_PASSWORD`   | Primary test user password                                             |
| `TEST_USER_SECONDARY_EMAIL`    | Secondary test user for multi-user tests                               |
| `TEST_USER_SECONDARY_PASSWORD` | Secondary test user password                                           |
| `TEST_USER_TERTIARY_EMAIL`     | Tertiary test user for group chat tests                                |
| `TEST_USER_TERTIARY_PASSWORD`  | Tertiary test user password                                            |
| `TEST_EMAIL_DOMAIN`            | Email domain for generated test emails (e.g., `you+e2e@gmail.com`)     |

**Note**: Supabase validates email domains have MX records. Use Gmail plus aliases (`user+tag@gmail.com`) instead of `@example.com` which is always blocked.

### 📝 Optional - Author & Site Configuration

These customize the site appearance but aren't required for builds:

| Secret                         | Description                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHOR_NAME`      | Your display name                 |

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOY_URL`       | Custom deployment URL             |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCIAL_PLATFORMS` | Comma-separated list of platforms |

### 📝 Optional - Integrations

| Secret                          | Description                         |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDAR_PROVIDER` | Calendar service (e.g., `calendly`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDAR_URL`      | Calendar booking URL                |

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`        | Sentry error-monitoring client DSN  |

Sentry monitoring is **disabled until `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is set** (empty = no-op) and only sends events **after the user grants analytics consent**. Get the DSN from sentry.io → your project → **Client Keys (DSN)**. All events are PII-scrubbed (emails, tokens, message bodies) before leaving the browser; session replay and tracing are disabled.

### 📝 Optional - Supabase Admin (for migrations)

| Secret                  | Description                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Personal access token for Management API |
| `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`  | Database password                        |
| `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`  | Project reference ID                     |

## 🔑 GitHub Personal Access Token (For Claude Code & SpecKit)

Claude Code and SpecKit use a GitHub token for **API access only** (reading issues, creating issues).
Git pushes use **SSH authentication** - keeping you in control of what gets committed.

### Creating Your Token (Read-Only API Access)

1. Go to **[GitHub Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)** (fine-grained tokens)

2. Configure the token:
   - **Token name**: `ScriptHammer` or `Claude Code`
   - **Expiration**: 90 days recommended
   - **Repository access**: Select "Only select repositories" → choose your repository

3. Grant these **read-only** permissions:

   | Permission    | Access        | Used For                         |
   | ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | Contents      | **Read-only** | Reading files, checking status   |
   | Issues        | Read & Write  | `/speckit.taskstoissues` command |
   | Pull requests | **Read-only** | Viewing PR status                |
   | Actions       | **Read-only** | Checking CI status               |

4. Click **Generate token** and copy it immediately (shown only once)

### Setup

**GitHub CLI**:

```bash
gh auth login
# Choose: GitHub.com → SSH → Paste token for API access
```

**Git pushes use SSH** (your existing SSH key):

```bash
# Verify SSH is configured
ssh -T git@github.com
# Should show: Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated...
```

### Why SSH + Limited Token?

- **You control commits** - AI can't push without your SSH key
- **API access only** - Token reads issues, creates issues, checks CI
- **No accidental pushes** - All pushes require explicit user action

## 🍴 Forking This Template

## ⚙️ Auto-Configuration

The project automatically detects your repository name and owner from git remote URL at build time:

- **Project name**: Detected from repository name
- **Owner**: Detected from GitHub username
- **Base path**: Configured for GitHub Pages deployment
- **PWA manifest**: Generated with your project name

**Troubleshooting**:

- If auto-detection fails, ensure you have a git remote: `git remote -v`
- Override with environment variables in `.env` if needed
- Check `src/config/project-detected.ts` after build to see detected values

## 📋 Technical Debt Backlog (SpecKit Ready)

For detailed tracking of E2E test fixes, helper patterns, and resolved issues, see [`docs/TECHNICAL-DEBT.md`](./docs/TECHNICAL-DEBT.md).

Run these specs in order (041 → 064). Copy a command to start the full SpecKit workflow.

### Priority 1: Blockers

**SPEC-041: ✅ COMPLETE** - GitHub secrets verified configured (2025-12-26). E2E status: **298 passed, 19 failed, 12 flaky, 61 skipped** (as of 2025-12-27).

**SPEC-042: ❌ INVALID** - File is NOT obsolete. Analysis: `tests/e2e/examples/homepage-with-pom.spec.ts` has 5 working tests + 4 skipped (with documented reasons). It's in `examples/` as a POM pattern teaching example. The 4 skips document former homepage features - this is valuable history, not technical debt.

### Priority 2: E2E Stabilization (mostly resolved - see TECHNICAL-DEBT.md)

**SPEC-043: ✅ COMPLETE** - Form honeypot fix merged (2025-12-26). Added `isHoneypotField()` helper to skip bot trap fields.

**SPEC-044: ✅ COMPLETE** - Accessibility contrast fix merged (2025-12-26). Changed `text-base-content/40` to `/60` in Footer.

**SPEC-045: ✅ COMPLETE** - Already fixed in commit 2a8aa08 (2025-12-26). All 43 message-editing tests pass.

**SPEC-046: ✅ COMPLETE** - Payment isolation fix merged (2025-12-26). Added `handlePaymentConsent()` helper. All 24 tests pass.

**SPEC-047: ✅ COMPLETE** - OAuth CSRF tests rewritten as proper security tests (2025-12-26).

**SPEC-048: ✅ COMPLETE** - Theme/PWA tests fixed with flexible assertions (2025-12-26).

### Session Continuation Prompt

```
Read these files to pick up the design system redesign:

1. CLAUDE.md - Project rules, Docker setup, component standards
2. docs/plans/2026-02-13-design-system-redesign.md - Approved design (Phase 4 section)
3. docs/plans/2026-02-13-design-system-implementation.md - Task-by-task plan
4. src/app/globals.css - Custom theme definitions (scripthammer-dark, scripthammer-light)

Use superpowers:executing-plans to work through the implementation plan.
Phases 0-6 complete. Next: final polish or new feature work.

Key context:
- Everything runs inside Docker: docker compose exec scripthammer <command>
- pnpm, not npm
- DaisyUI beta with Tailwind v4 CSS-first config (@plugin syntax)
- ScriptHammer is a template, design must be bold but also easy to rebrand
- Brand colors: silver/steel (primary), warm amber (secondary), electric accent, charcoal base
- Dark theme default, light variant available
- Both themes pass WCAG AAA (7:1) contrast
- Preserve all existing accessibility work
- Aesthetic: bold, industrial, developer-focused. VS Code dark meets metallic craftsmanship.
- Component hierarchy: 22 atomic, 17 molecular, 8 organisms
- Pattern: audit component in Storybook against both themes, update, verify a11y, commit

<summary>🧰 E2E Fix Loop Priming Prompt (for maintainers)</summary>

If the E2E test suite is broken and you want to run `/loop` to keep iterating on it,
paste the priming prompt from [docs/e2e-loop-priming.md](./docs/e2e-loop-priming.md)
into the loop command. It lists the **current open issues** (not a baseline) with
concrete symptoms, what's been tried, what failed, and rules for not regressing.

**Current state (2026-04-19, commit `4b003d5`)**: NOT green. Latest run `24624967629`
failed. The GoTrue brute-force lockouts that plagued rounds 1-10 are solved (pre-auth
User B fixture, commit `1477816`), but 3 categories of hard-fail remain:

1. **`payment-isolation.spec.ts`** on chromium-gen/firefox-gen/webkit-gen 4/6 —
   storageState-based auth hydration is unreliable in manually-created
   `browser.newContext()` on these tests. Tests 44, 113, 184, 216 see user=null
   where project-level `{ page }` storageState works fine.
2. **Firefox realtime WebSocket** rejects Cloudflare's `__cf_bm` cookie on
   Supabase's `/realtime/v1/websocket` endpoint — firefox-msg-specific, infrastructure.
3. **Webkit shard cancellation cascade** when one upstream webkit shard fails —
   workflow-level artifact propagation, not test content.

**Also required (user action, not code)**: Supabase dashboard rate-limit exemption
per [`docs/testing/CI-SETUP.md`](./docs/testing/CI-SETUP.md). Without it, the ~15
legitimate live `performSignIn` calls in auth/ tests can still trigger lockouts.

Do not treat the priming doc as a clean baseline — read its "Current Open Issues"
section for where things actually stand.
